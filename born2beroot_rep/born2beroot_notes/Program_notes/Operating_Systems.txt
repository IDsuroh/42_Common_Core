'aptitude' or 'apt'?

apt: Advanced Packaging Tool

- Packaging Tool that manages the instalation and uninstalation of a software.
- was made to manage '.deb' packages
- compatible with 'rpm' package manager now.
    
    ****RPM Package Manager (RPM), originally called the Red Hat Package Manager,
        is an open source program for installing, uninstalling and managing
        software packages in Linux.

- 'apt' uses command lines without graphic interface.
- when installing and typing the package name,
- it installs the package and the dependencies to 
            '/etc/apt/sources.list' automatically.
        
        ***What are dependencies?
            In Linux, dependencies are libraries, packages, or modules
            installed in order to run a program smoothly. Sometimes, when we
            install a package, its dependencies are not installed
            automatically or may be missing. So, as a Linux administrator,
            knowing how to install these dependencies is essential.

        ***
            With 'apt', there is no need to worry about dependencies and it is
            very flexible since it is possible to do certain things like...
        ->
            maintaining the current package withoutbeing updated even though
            the user adds a new source list manually or when the system
            updates.


aptitude: is broader and includes functions such as apt-get, apt-cache, and
            so on.

- if apt-get does things like...
    - installing packages.
    - upgrading packages.
    - system upgrade.
    - dependency check.

- aptitude can do lot more things like...
    - toggling package or package list installation to automatic or manual.
    - saving packages that cannot be used to the upgrade.
