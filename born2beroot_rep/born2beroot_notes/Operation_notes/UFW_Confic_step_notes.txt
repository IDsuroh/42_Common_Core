UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly command-line interface
for managing a firewall on Linux systems, particularly those based on
Debian/Ubuntu. It simplifies the process of setting up firewall rules,
making it easier to allow or block traffic to specific services, ports,
or IP addresses without having to deal with the complexity of more
advanced firewall tools like iptables.
